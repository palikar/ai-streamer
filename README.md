# AIStreamer

AIStreamer is my personal library/framework for streamlining the process of writing and deploying scripts for machine learning models, image processing and generally &ldquo;AI stuff&rdquo;. Hence *AIStream(lin)er*.


## Abstract

So at some point, I came up with the idea to write a simple framework that should abstract away the boilerplate code and allow to actually write the interesting parts of the scripts/applications without me every time worrying about how everything should come together.


### Design goals

-   Flexibility - The framework should not limit what I can write. I should be able to write every model that I can write from scratch using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/%0A%0A), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [Opencv](https://opencv.org/) and what have you.
-   Extendability - adding new features should not require any substantial rewrites of the core components. The architecture should allow &ldquo;hot swappable&rdquo; components.
-   Sort of simple to use (at least when following the documentation). (This nicely ties up to the next point.)
-   Good documentation and clear architecture so that I can &ldquo;relearn&rdquo; everything with relative ease.
